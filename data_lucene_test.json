I've been more partial to longer holidays and have gotten 3-4 weeks in Africa, 3 weeks in Hawaii, a 3 month roadtrip each for under $10k for two.  \n\nWhat's the point of a nice hotel if I'm going to be out for nearly all my waking hours?", "The jobs that pay 180k are generally not in areas where the cost of living is so low.", "True, but location, location, location. \n\nIt just depends what you want and obviously what you can afford. I\u2019ve stayed in hostels most of my life when I traveled. \n\nI\u2019m not 100% on board spending that much to have free beer, but shit, I blow way more money back home on crap so might as well give it to a great organization that provides jobs and income for a poor part of the country that is honestly beautiful. \n\nThe guy who started this chain had the same idea. Shine a (slightly expensive) light on an underdeveloped region, do it well, make it easy, and voila, you\u2019re on the front page. \n\nNot saying it\u2019s for everybody and I\u2019m not doing it again anytime soon but it sure was fun as hell and so smart for people who don\u2019t want to think too much about travel", "Idk, but I love it too. Honestly a good beer compared to our miller lite", "[deleted]", "I hear what you\u2019re saying\u2014there are many different ways to travel and for some people this fits the bill. Even if I can afford it though, personally, I\u2019ll never quite understand the concept of spending this much money on a hotel room for two people. I say that simply because unless you\u2019re spending a lot of time in your room (which is stupid), you\u2019re not in your room at times when you can really enjoy this view. As soon as it goes dark that\u2019s pretty much it for the view, and that\u2019s the time you would be in there. \n\nSo yeah, that just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Especially since others have pointed out there are much cheaper, but still good, hotels in the surrounding area too. I would rather do a blow out meal for $500, stay in a $200/night room, and save $1000/night, if I was looking to splurge. ", "I misread and never noticed the word law in your previous post. Thought you were vaguely describing all job markets.\n\nMy apologies.\nYou're probbably right, I don't know shit about law school.", "That\u2019s why there\u2019s more than one hotel (:"]}]
